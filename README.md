# contact-backend

This project is a backend service for managing contacts, built with Node.js and Express.js, and connected to MongoDB. The service exposes APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting contact information, and is designed to be deployed globally on the cloud. The project also includes JWT authentication and password hashing for secure user management.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete contacts
- User authentication with JWT
- Password hashing for secure storage
- RESTful API design
- MongoDB as the database
- Designed for global deployment on the cloud

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v17.x or higher)
- MongoDB

- `DELETE /contacts/:id` - Delete a contact by ID (requires JWT)

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- JWTs are used for authenticating API requests. Ensure you keep your JWT secret safe and secure.
